# Realest-POTUS-tweets (NLP Text Generator)

### Executive Summary

I used NLP model to automatically generate tweets with a starting seed word. The process is quite simple but I'll be making refinements later on to make it fun for a user to play with. I hope that the end product will be akin to asking Trump what he thinks about a certain topic. 

The current model is based on a cleaned tweets from Trump in 2015 until 2020. There's still a lot to be done:
1. The NLP is character based, so there are still made up words; 
2. There appears to be a lot of strange characters in Trump's tweets, I'll need to read through them and do a thorough clean;
3. User Input portion still needs to be done.
